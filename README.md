```bash

## a white dot next to the file name means the file is not saved yet

## node javascriptFile.js will run it

## node.js allows us to run js directly from the backend

## in the console, the strings are printed in white and numbers in yellow

## to initialize the project at first and create a package.json
npm init -y


############DEFINITIONS##############

## Declaring a var
Giving it a name

## Initialization
Assigning a value to a var

## Mutable
The data can change after it has been created

## Uninitialized
Declared var without a value given

## Non-primitive
Can hold more complex data, they are mutable

## Primitive data
Can hold only 1 value at a time

## Index
Value representing the position of the value in an array

## Mutation
Changing values (ie. in an array)

## Method
Function specifically associated with certain values or objects as a property of those

## Autoboxing
JS treating primitives like strings, numbers, booleans as objects temporarily when you call a method on them (console.log; toUpperCase)

## Concatenation
Joining var together

## Iterable
Object that can be looped over

## Iterator
Object accessing the iterable one value at a time

## Parameter
Value used in the function declaration

## Argument
Value passed in the function when that function is called

## Function definition
The function itself not its call

## Reference error
When trying to access a var that is not accessible, meaning it’s out of scope or does not exist

## Function call
Calling the function, it’s that moment when you pass it arguments

## Expression
Can be a function, object, variable, anything that returns a value

## One indexed loop
A loop that starts at 1 instead of the usual 0

## Falsy values
false, 0, NaN, undefined, "", null

## Strict equality operator
===

## Object
Non primitive data types that hold key-value pairs

## Indices
numerical values that start at 0

## Bracket notation
myFunction(arg[0])

## Compound assignment
num += 5

## Ternary operator
ondition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

## Reference Error
When a non existant var is referenced

## Type Error
The code is trying to perform an operation on a value that is not of the expected type

## Prefixing with is and has
Common practice to indicate the var is a bool

## null
the abscence of value

## NodeList
Array like object

## Global error flag
A variable used to keep track of whether an error has occurred during program execution.

## Recursion
Programming concept where a function calls itself

## Base case
When the function stops calling itself

## Recursive case
Where the function calls itself

## Stack
Data structure where items are stored in a LIFO, last-in-first-out, manner

## call stack
Collection of function calls stored in a stack structure, When you call a function, it is added to the top of the stack, and when it returns, it is removed from the top / end of the stack

## bubbleSort algorythm
Sorting algorithm which starts at the beginning of the array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted

## selectionSort algorythm
Finds the smallest value in the array, then swapps it with the first value in the array. Then, it finds the next smallest value in the array, and swaps it with the second value in the array. It continues iterating through the array until it is completely sorted

## insertionSort algorythm
Builds up a sorted array at the beginning of the list. The sorted array is the first element. Then it inspects the next element and swaps it backward into the sorted array until it is in a sorted position.
